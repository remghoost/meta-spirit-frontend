This is just a repo to run https://huggingface.co/adamo1139/Meta_Spirit-LM-ungated

I do not own anything related to any of this.

This will probably *not* be maintained and is literally just to get you up and running with it.

This repo is messy and dumb, but it *should* work.

---

## Steps to run

- `git clone` this repo
- `run.bat`

---

- This assumes you want to use the base model, which the repo owner says works better than the expressive model overall
- This uses torch 2.4.1
